# Contract Management Implementation Roadmap

## ✅ What We're Building

A **simple, visual system** for managing government contract execution from CLINs → Objectives → Outcomes → Tasks.

### Key User Flows

#### 1. **PM/Contract Manager Flow** (Setup)
```
1. Create/View Contract
2. Add CLINs (funding buckets)
   → Auto-show: Total value, type, period
3. Create Objectives (from SOW)
   → Allocate budget from CLINs (drag & drop)
4. Monitor: Budget burn, objective progress, CLIN health
```

#### 2. **Team Lead Flow** (Execution)
```
1. View "My Objectives" dashboard
2. Break objectives into Outcomes
   → Define success criteria
   → Set target dates
3. Create Tasks under outcomes
4. Assign team members
5. Track: Budget remaining, outcome progress, blockers
```

#### 3. **Team Member Flow** (Daily Work)
```
1. View "My Tasks" (assigned to me)
2. Update status & log hours
3. Create tickets for other teams
4. Mark outcomes complete when delivered
```

#### 4. **Executive Flow** (Oversight)
```
1. Contract health dashboard
2. CLIN burn rate trends
3. Objective delivery status
4. Risk alerts
5. Monthly report generation
```

## 🎯 Implementation Phases

### **Phase 1: Core Data & Simple CRUD** (Week 1) ✅ STARTED
**Goal:** Get the structure working, no AI yet

**Database Tables:**
- ✅ `pmbook-CLIN` - Funding buckets
- ✅ `pmbook-Objective` - Strategic goals
- ✅ `pmbook-Outcome` - Measurable deliverables
- ✅ `pmbook-Task` - Execution units
- ✅ `pmbook-CLINAllocation` - Budget tracking
- ✅ `pmbook-MonthlyReport` - Generated reports

**Pages to Build:**
- ✅ `/contracts/[id]` - Contract detail with tabs
- `/contracts/[id]/clins/new` - Add CLIN wizard
- `/contracts/[id]/objectives/new` - Create objective + allocate budget
- `/objectives/[id]/outcomes` - Outcome management
- `/outcomes/[id]/tasks` - Task board (Kanban style)

**Key Features:**
- Visual budget allocation (show available funds)
- Progress bars everywhere
- Simple forms with smart defaults
- Real-time calculations

---

### **Phase 2: Team Dashboards** (Week 2)
**Goal:** Make it useful for day-to-day work

**Pages:**
- `/dashboard/team-lead` - My objectives, budget, outcomes
- `/dashboard/team-member` - My tasks, tickets
- `/dashboard/pm` - Contract overview, all objectives
- `/tickets` - Inter-team work requests

**UX Enhancements:**
- Quick actions (+ Create Task, + Create Outcome)
- Filters (My Team, High Priority, Overdue)
- Bulk operations (Assign multiple tasks)
- Notifications (Budget alerts, task assignments)

---

### **Phase 3: Budget Flow & Allocation** (Week 3)
**Goal:** Visual, intuitive budget management

**Features:**
- **CLIN → Objective Allocation:**
  - Drag budget cards from CLINs to objectives
  - Visual validation (can't over-allocate)
  - "Suggested allocation" based on priority

- **Objective → Outcome Breakdown:**
  - Pie chart showing budget split
  - Warn if total > objective budget
  - Auto-calculate remaining funds

- **Outcome Cost Tracking:**
  - Task estimates roll up to outcome
  - Real-time burn vs. budget
  - Forecast completion cost

**Visualizations:**
- Sankey diagram: CLINs → Objectives → Outcomes
- Budget waterfall chart
- Burn-down charts by CLIN

---

### **Phase 4: Reporting & Compliance** (Week 4)
**Goal:** Auto-generate monthly CLIN reports

**Report Sections:**
1. **Cost Summary**
   - Planned vs. Actual by CLIN
   - Variance analysis
   - Burn rate trend

2. **Schedule Performance**
   - Outcomes planned vs. delivered
   - Late deliverables
   - Upcoming milestones

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Deliverables completed
   - Quality indicators
   - Team velocity

4. **Risk & Issues**
   - Budget overrun risks
   - Schedule delays
   - Resource constraints

**Output Formats:**
- PDF (customer delivery)
- Excel (detailed data)
- JSON (API access)

**AI Summary:**
- "Contract on track, CLIN 0002 at 85% burn with 2 months remaining"
- "3 outcomes delayed, recommend reallocation from CLIN 0005"

---

### **Phase 5: AI-Powered Insights** (Week 5-6)
**Goal:** Proactive intelligence, not reactive reporting

**1. Cost Prediction**
```typescript
Agent analyzes:
- Historical burn rates (team velocity)
- Similar past outcomes (pattern matching)
- Task complexity vs. estimates
→ "Outcome X will cost $125k (est: $100k) based on team pace"
```

**2. Risk Detection**
```typescript
Monitors:
- Tasks with no updates > 7 days
- Budget burn > 80% with < 50% progress
- CLIN depletion outpacing PoP
→ Alert: "CLIN 0002 will deplete 45 days before end date"
```

**3. Smart Recommendations**
```typescript
Suggests:
- Team assignment: "DevOps has 30% capacity, assign Outcome Y"
- Budget reallocation: "CLIN 0005 underutilized, move $50k to Objective 3"
- Task prioritization: "Work on Outcome A first, blocks 3 other teams"
```

**4. Auto-Ticket Routing**
```typescript
When team creates task requiring another team:
- AI suggests best team based on skills
- Auto-fills SLA based on priority
- Notifies team lead for approval
```

---

### **Phase 6: Team Incentives & Gamification** (Week 7)
**Goal:** Make teams WANT to use this

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Delivery Score:** On-time + on-budget outcomes
- **Innovation Credits:** Solutions that save cost
- **Collaboration Points:** Helping other teams
- **Quality Rating:** Low rework, high customer satisfaction

**Leaderboards:**
- Team rankings (not individual to avoid toxicity)
- Month-over-month improvement
- "Team of the Quarter" recognition

**Rewards:**
- Early delivery = more autonomy on next outcome
- Under-budget = % of savings to discretionary budget
- High quality = priority on new opportunities

**Visibility:**
- Executive dashboard shows top-performing teams
- Success stories highlighted in reports
- Outcomes showcased to customer
